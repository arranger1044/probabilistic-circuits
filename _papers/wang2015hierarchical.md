abstract: "Recognizing actions from still images has been popularly studied recently. In this paper, we model an action class as a flexible number of spatial configurations of body parts by proposing a new spatial sum-product network (SPN). First, we discover a set of parts in image collections via unsupervised learning. Then, our new spatial SPN is applied to model the spatial relationship and also the high-order correlations of parts. To learn robust networks, we further develop a hierarchical spatial SPN method, which models pairwise spatial relationship between parts inside subimages and models the correlation of subimages via extra layers of SPN. Our method is shown to be effective on two benchmark data sets."
