abstract: "Sum-Product Networks (SPNs) are a highly efficient type of a deep probabilistic model that allows exact inference in time linear in the size of the network.  In previous work, several heuristic structure learning approaches for SPNs have been developed, which are prone to overfitting compared to a purely Bayesian model. In this work, we propose a principled approach to structure learning in SPNs by introducing infinite Sum-Product Trees (SPTs). Our approach is the first correct and successful extension of SPNs to a Bayesian nonparametric model. We show that infinite SPTs can be used successfully to discover SPN structures and outperform infinite Gaussian mixture models in the task of density estimation."
