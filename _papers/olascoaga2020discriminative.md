abstract: "Methods that learn the structure of Probabilistic Sentential Decision Diagrams (PSDD) from data have achieved state-of-the-art performance in tractable learning tasks. These methods learn PSDDs incrementally by optimizing the likelihood of the induced probability distribution given available data and are thus robust against missing values, a relevant trait to address the challenges of embedded applications, such as failing sensors and resource constraints. However PSDDs are outperformed by discriminatively trained models in classification tasks. In this work, we introduce D-LearnPSDD, a learner that improves the classification performance of the LearnPSDD algorithm by introducing a discriminative bias that encodes the conditional relation between the class and feature variables."
