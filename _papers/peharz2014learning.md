abstract: "We consider the selectivity constraint on the structure of sum-product networks (SPNs), which allows each sum node to have at most one child with non-zero output for each possible input. This allows us to find globally optimal maximum likelihood parameters in closed form. Although being a constrained class of SPNs, these models still strictly generalize classical graphical models such as Bayesian networks. Closed form parameter estimation opens the door for structure learning using a principled scoring function, trading off training likelihood and model complexity. In experiments we show that these models are easy to learn and compete well with state of the art."
