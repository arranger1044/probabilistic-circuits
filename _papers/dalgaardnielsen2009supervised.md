abstract: "A new model for supervised classification based on probabilistic decision graphs is introduced. A probabilistic decision graph (PDG) is a graphical model that efficiently captures certain context specific independencies that are not easily represented by other graphical models traditionally used for classification, such as the Na√Øve Bayes (NB) or Classification Trees (CT). This means that the PDG model can capture some distributions using fewer parameters than classical models. Two approaches for constructing a PDG for classification are proposed. The first is to directly construct the model from a dataset of labelled data, while the second is to transform a previously obtained Bayesian classifier into a PDG model that can then be refined. These two approaches are compared with a wide range of classical approaches to the supervised classification problem on a number of both real world databases and artificially generated data."
