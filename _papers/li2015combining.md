abstract: "Ontology matching is the key challenge to achieve semantic interoperability in building the Semantic Web. We present an alternative probabilistic scheme, called GMap, which
combines the sum-product network and the noisy-or model. More precisely, we employ the
sum-product network to encode the similarities based on individuals and disjointness
axioms across ontologies and calculate the contributions by the maximum a posterior
inference. The noisy-or model is used to encode the probabilistic matching rules, which are independent of each other as well asthe value calculated by the sum-product network. Experiments show thatGMap is competitive with many OAEI top-ranked systems. Futhermore,GMap, benefited from these two graphical models, can keep inferencetractable in the whole matching process."
