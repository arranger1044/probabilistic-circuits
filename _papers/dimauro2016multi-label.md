abstract: "In this work, we tackle the problem of Multi-Label Classification (MLC) by using Cutset Networks (CNets), weighted probabilistic model trees, recently proposed as tractable probabilistic models for discrete distributions. We employ CNets to perform Most Probable Explanation (MPE) inference exactly and efficiently and we improve a state-of-the-art structure learning algorithm for CNets by explicitly taking advantage of label dependencies. We achieve this by forcing the tree inner nodes to represent only feature variables and by exploiting structural heuristics while learning the leaf models. A thorough experimental evaluation on ten real-world datasets shows how the proposed approach improves several metrics for MLC, proving it to be competitive with problem transformation methods like classifier chains."
