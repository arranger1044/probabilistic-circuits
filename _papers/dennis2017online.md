abstract: "A variety of algorithms exist for learning both the structure and parameters of sum-product networks (SPNs), a class of probabilistic model in which exact inference can be done quickly. The vast majority of them are batch learners, including a recently proposed algorithm, SEARCHSPN. However, SEARCHSPN has properties that make it particularly suited for adaptation to the online setting. In this paper we introduce the ONLINESEARCHSPN algorithm which does just that. We compare it to two general methods that build online learners from batch learners; one learns poor models quickly and the other learns good models slowly. Our experiments show that ONLINESEARCHSPN achieves the best of both methods. The test likelihood values of the models it learns are as good as the slow learner, while the training times needed to learn the models are much closer to the fast learner."
