abstract: "This paper introduces a probabilistic architecture called sum–product graphical model (SPGM). SPGMs represent a class of probability distributions that combines, for the first time, the semantics of probabilistic graphical models (GMs) with the evaluation efficiency of sum–product networks (SPNs): Like SPNs, SPGMs always enable tractable inference using a class of models that incorporate context specific independence. Like GMs, SPGMs provide a high-level model interpretation in terms of conditional independence assumptions and corresponding factorizations. Thus, this approach provides new connections between the fields of SPNs and GMs, and enables a high-level interpretation of the family of distributions encoded by SPNs. We provide two applications of SPGMs in density estimation with empirical results close to or surpassing state-of-the-art models. The theoretical and practical results demonstrate that jointly exploiting properties of SPNs and GMs is an interesting direction of future research."
