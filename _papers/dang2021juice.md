abstract: "JUICE is an open-source Julia package providing tools for logic and probabilistic reasoning and learning based on logic circuits (LCs) and probabilistic circuits (PCs). It provides arange of efficient algorithms for probabilistic inference queries, such as computing marginal probabilities (MAR), as well as many more advanced queries. Certain structural circuit proper-ties are needed to achieve this tractability, which JUICE helps validate. Additionally, it supports several parameter and struc-ture learning algorithms proposed in the recent literature. By leveraging parallelism (on both CPU and GPU), JUICE provides a fast implementation of circuit-based algorithms, which makes it suitable for tackling large-scale datasets and models."
