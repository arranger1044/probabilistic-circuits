abstract: "Sum-product networks (SPNs) are a recently proposed type of probabilistic graphical models allowing complex variable interactions while still granting efficient inference. In this paper we demonstrate the suitability of SPNs for modeling log-spectra of speech signals using the application of artificial bandwidth extension, i.e. artificially replacing the high-frequency content which is lost in telephone signals. We use SPNs as observation models in hidden Markov models (HMMs), which model the temporal evolution of log short-time spectra. Missing frequency bins are replaced by the SPNs using most-probable-explanation inference, where the state-dependent reconstructions are weighted with the HMM state posterior."
