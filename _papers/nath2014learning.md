abstract: "Sum-product networks (SPNs) are a recently proposed deep architecture that guarantees tractable inference, even on certain high-treewidth models. SPNs are a propositional architecture, treating the instances as independent and identically distributed. In this paper, we introduce Relational Sum-Product Networks (RSPNs), a new tractable first-order probabilistic architecture. RSPNs generalize SPNs by modeling a set of instances jointly, allowing them to influence each otherâ€™s probability distributions, as well as modeling the probabilities of relations between objects. We also present LearnRSPN, the first algorithm for learning tractable statistical relational models. LearnRSPN is a recursive top-down structure learning algorithm for RSPNs,  similar to the LearnSPN algorithm for propositional SPN learning. In preliminary experiments,  RSPNs outperform Markov Logic Networks in both running time and predictive accuracy."
